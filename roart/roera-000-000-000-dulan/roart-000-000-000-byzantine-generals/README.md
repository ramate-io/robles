## Summary
[The Byzantine Generals Problem](./the-byzantine-generals-problem.pdf) describes the central problem of expensive coordination inherent to fault-tolerant systems. The easing of fault constraints which begins in this paper is essential to the BFT corpus and is echoed in our attempts to establish the class BFA.

## Description
The Byzantine Generals Problem provides the key theoretical realization that fault-tolerant coordination algorithms are "expensive" and "the only way to
reduce the cost is to make assumptions about the type of failure that may occur" (Lamport et al., 1982, p. 401).

This foundational paper informs [FLP Impossibility](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/jacm85.pdf), [Consensus in the Presence of Partial Synchrony](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/jacm88.pdf), and [PBFT](http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf) which together form the core theoretical backbone for BFT systems.

## Justification
[The Byzantine Generals Problem](./the-byzantine-generals-problem.pdf) is primarily included as an example for the ROART format. In general, we expect ROART to be more often generated by direct contributors to OAC. However, the inclusion of important canonical works from other corpii is also and important function of this format.

Separately, the [The Byzantine Generals Problem](./the-byzantine-generals-problem.pdf) describes the important theoretical realization that "the only way to
reduce the cost is to make assumptions about the type of failure that may occur" (Lamport et al., 1982, p. 401). This realization sets the stage for all practical classes of fault-tolerant coordination protocol to follow and is an otherwise implicit assumption in our definitions of BFT-related protocol classes.
