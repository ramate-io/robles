0:00 Hey everybody, I wanted to make this, uh, demo of the Roblox repository. I'm going to keep this very short, uhm, the Roblox repository has the same structure as is described in the OAC video and uses the same organization, organizational principles with respect to Remate, uhm, as is described in the

0:33 Uhm, I'll just briefly show you that, you know, we have like the same contributing setup with the events, release candidates, features, and bugs.
