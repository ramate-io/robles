# ROGLO-0: Stack Member
- **Authors:** [Liam Monninger](liam@ramate.io)
- **Word:** "Stack Member"

## Definition
A "Stack Member" is anything linked and described from [README.md#stack-members](/README.md#stack-members).

"Included" Stack Members are those artifacts found on the `main` branch of this repository.

All other Stack Members are either "Proposed" or "Revoked" and their status is reflected in their source control history.

## Usage
- All Stack Members should be well documented.
- Robles' Stack Members can be thought of as layers for programming a distributed and decentralized system.
