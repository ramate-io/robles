## Summary
Ordered Atomic Collaboration is a paradigm for decentralized consequence. OAC differs from traditional and popular decentralized and distributed compute in its emphasis on structures for penalization as opposed to perfect consensus. We believe OAC can be used to replace traditional DLT applications. However, OAC's long-term ambitions lie in the decentralized coordination of swarms.

## Proclamation
Ordered Atomic Collaboration is a paradigm for decentralized consequence.

OAC imagines a technrological future wherein the value of secure compute over shared state is understood not in terms of participation for gain--but in terms of economies rendered against maliciousness. These economies form consequence from decentralized participation; they induce an order which becomes preferential to alternatives.

### Why OAC?
OAC is ordered atomic collaboration:
- OAC is **ordered** because it deals with the class of programs over shared state which must be properly ordered to compute correct state transitions.
- OAC is **atomic** because these state transitions must either always complete or always fail.
- OAC is **collaborative** because it seeks decentralized participation to produce economics against maliciousness.

### How do OAC's objectives differ from existing technrologies?
OAC skews away from traditional and popular decentralized and distributed compute in several ways:

#### I1: Large footprint
OAC focuses on large footprint systems--with the ambition of deriving greater performance and security.

#### I2: BFA
OAC reduces networked compute to a more permissive class of protocols known as [BFA](../../../roart/roera-000-000-000-dulan/roart-000-000-001-bfa/README.md)--protocols allowing Byzantine faults with some known error rate.

#### I3: Expanded Incentivization
OAC aims to move the problem of incentivization and costliness out from the stake- and work-based systems of today to a broader class of economic structures.

In many instances, this means implementers can build incentivized protocols without tokens.

#### I4: Pipelining and Exotic Task Distribution
OAC seeks to maximize pipelining of compute to drive performance and increase opportunities for participation.

#### I5: Penalty-driven
OAC de-emphasizes perfect consensus. The primary motive of OAC is to track states and generate incentives that make it easy to enforce penalties against malicious actors--and thus provide economies for machines.

### What would be built with OAC?
When used carefully, we believe OAC can supplant traditional and popular decentralized and distributed compute under requirements such as smart execution and state machine replication. However, OAC's long-term ambitions lie in machine-to-machine communication. We believe OAC can be used to help solve challenging problems in AI alignment, dPIN verification, and decentralized swarm coordination.
